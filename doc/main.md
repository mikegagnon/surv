We'll offer you the training free of charge, so you can evaluate us.
You decide how much to invest into the investigation: are we worth it?

Be the best video surveillance company on Earth. How to be the best. For 
24 hours worth of surveillance hire 72 hours worth of eyes. This way there's
always surveillance staff playing ping pong, foosball, and pool. This way,
surveillance staff can take 20 minutes shifts and 40 minute breaks. This way
the surveillance staff is always fresh when staring at a CCTV screen.
This way, we're the best because we have the freshest, most vigilant eyes 
closely watching everything that goes on on the CCTV. We'll hire trained marines,
fresh out of the service to monitor the CCTVs. We'll sell our service to
billionaires, because they want the best and they're willing to pay a premium
for it. We'll use a [net-centric decision support system](https://ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/publications/publication-files/full_papers/2010_06_25_Gagnon_ISARCS_FP.pdf)
to achieve decision superiority using Zen Beer Garden principles. Our decision support system (DSS) will enable surveillance staff to observe, orient, decide, and consistently effect the best decisions possible.
For example, our DSS will use computer vision to identify all the people on CCTV,
and thereby maintain a heartbeat map of the people outside the protected building.
When an event that is worth alerting occurs, the surveillance staff will use the
DSS staff to alert the security staff of the event as well as rapid intelligence
giving security staff the information they need to make good decisions.
To cope with false positives, encourage vigilance, and monitor & assure our 
performance, we will hire independent red-team organizations
to regularly attempt to penetrate our secured buildings.

I've been the best before, and I'm going to do it again.
I've been on a three year hiatus, but I'm almost healed and ready to go
back into 100%. Last week I had the best work week in three years.

I'm going to move to Washington D.C. and be scrappy. I'm going to move in with
my parents in Alexandria, VA, only smoke pot when it's legal, and launch
the world's best surveillance company. And we're going to get rich doing it.

Why do this? So I can materialize greatness, play by the rules and [conquer Earth](##upgrade).
We'll call it Surv, pronounced serve.

How to deal with false positives? Tune the system to handle false positives.
Assume you won't get rid of false positives. Instead, increase the number of
true positives via red teams that model well the world of threats.
Then, operators operate under the assumption that 9 out of ten positives are false.
But the operator is actively searching for the true positives.

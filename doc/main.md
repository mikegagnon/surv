Price formula


~fair
## A fair deal

Imagine you want to do perimeter video surveillance in-house.
It would cost you $X if you were to use our model.

Or, you can pay us 2$X, we'll do it for you, and you won't have to assemble an
elite team.

You can even hire us for a while, then drop us and assemble your own elite
team later.

~redblue
## Red Team

We sell our blue team, and we sell our red team. Would you like us to evaluate
your security system? May we challenge you to evaluate each other via
mutual red-teaming.


* We give you [100 points of value](##100value) in exchange for 100 points in cash.

~100value

~ideas
## Ideas

We can afford to be generous because we claim to be the best.
Yes, we're more expensive, but aim to be the best
in our category.
We can afford to throw around
low prices and high margins.

## Meditator


~chance
## Chance
Take a chance on open business and me.
* A trained meditator watches a screen, taking a 20-minute break every 20-minutes
* Whenever a breech occurs on the screen, the meditator pushes the appropriate button
* To help keep the meditator focused, we frequently play videos of breeches.




* We pipe your camera into our computer system


~misc
## Misc

* You can afford the best, and we can accommodate you
* You pay the minimum price, in exchange for a fair deal
* Fair means, we split it 50-50, like a temporary partnership
* Because it's fair, there's 100 points of value that's being exchanged each way.

How many people per camera per hour?

* 4 screens per desktop
* For every operator on duty, there's an off-duty substitute operator
* Thus, it's two people per desktop (one on duty, one off duty)
* During any given period, about half the screen time shows red-team recordings to
enhance vigilance. Thus, each desktop only shows two live camera feeds at a time.
* So two employees can cover two live camera feeds. So, one employee per camera.

* $40k a year = $14/hour/employee = $14/hour/camera
* $14/hour/camera * 24hours = $336/day/camera = $2,352/week/camera =
  $12.2k/year/camera
* We receive a 20% profit over personnel costs. So, the cost is:
    * 1.2 * $336/day/camera = $403/day/camera
    * 1.2 * $2352/week/camera = $2.8k/week/camera
    * 1.2 * $12.2k/year/camera = $14k/year/camera

Team up with integrators:
- Half the points go to the customer
- Half the points go to us
- We split our half with integrators, and they help us find personnel and customers for free.

Profit sharing

Surveilling at ZBG is like playing a video game. You watch the screen closely
and fire alarms when appropriate. Bad guys will be constantly penetrating 
the perimeter, and you'll need to fire the alarm  100immediately. You won't know
when you're watching a recording of someone hopping the fence or whether you're
watching live CCTV.

For 40k a year you'll work 40 hours a week.
You will alternate between 20 minutes on duty, and 40 minutes off duty.
When off duty you can be on Facebook or whatever else you choose.
We will provide 3 meals a day, as well as travel and lodging should that be
required.

## Details

- You provide personnel or a budget for personnel
- We give the personnel a 3-week hinayana meditation retreat
- We give the personnel a 1-week training course in [Net-centric decision support](##ncds) for
video surveillance
- We test our surveillance service using an independent real-world modeled red-team
- If you decide to continue our service, we continue to charge a [20% profit margin](##price).
- Our personnel make $40k a year, with benefits: three meals a day per diem.

~ncds
## Net-centric decision support

The idea for Net-centric decision support (NCDS) is to build the best user interfaces to optimize AI-human interaction
as part of an effort to make the best decisions as quickly as possible.

The crux of NCDS is enhancing the OODA loop, the cycle of observing, orienting, deciding,
and acting.

Within the context of video surveillance, we use [computer-human vision](##vision) to identify
potential threats, and provide an easy to use interface for operators to investigate
threats and sound alarms. Key challenges include [enhancing vigilance](##vig) while
[mitigating false negatives and false positives](##errors).

With this approach we will be able to sound the alarm the moment someone breeches
your perimeter.

See [Michael Gagnon's](##michael) paper:
[Towards Net-Centric Cyber Survivability for Ballistic Missile Defense](##cyber).

~price
## 20% profit margin

Whether your provide personnel or we provide personnel, for the purpose of
calculating costs, we assume personnel make $40k a year, plus per diem according
to the federal government's per diem rate.

Included in the cost is the 4-week retreat / training program.

Included in the cost is the red-team evaluation, for both the red-team and 
the blue-team personnel.

We need at least three blue team members and one red-team member.

We multiply the cost by 1.2, and we take the 0.2 above the cost as profit.

We'll offer you the training free of charge, so you can evaluate us.
You decide how much to invest into the investigation: are we worth it?

- You provide personnel or a budget for personnel
- Your personnel use our system for as long as you would like, from one to 
40 days.
- We make a 20% profit margin. You multiply your costs by 1.2 and we take the 0.2
of that (everything above 1.0).

Be the best video surveillance company on Earth. How to be the best. For 
24 hours worth of surveillance hire 72 hours worth of eyes. This way there's
always surveillance staff playing ping pong, foosball, and pool. This way,
surveillance staff can take 20 minutes shifts and 40 minute breaks. This way
the surveillance staff is always fresh when staring at a CCTV screen.
This way, we're the best because we have the freshest, most vigilant eyes 
closely watching everything that goes on on the CCTV. We'll hire trained marines,
fresh out of the service to monitor the CCTVs. We'll sell our service to
billionaires, because they want the best and they're willing to pay a premium
for it. We'll use a [net-centric decision support system](https://ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/publications/publication-files/full_papers/2010_06_25_Gagnon_ISARCS_FP.pdf)
to achieve decision superiority using Zen Beer Garden principles. Our decision support system (DSS) will enable surveillance staff to observe, orient, decide, and consistently effect the best decisions possible.
For example, our DSS will use computer vision to identify all the people on CCTV,
and thereby maintain a heartbeat map of the people outside the protected building.
When an event that is worth alerting occurs, the surveillance staff will use the
DSS staff to alert the security staff of the event as well as rapid intelligence
giving security staff the information they need to make good decisions.
To cope with false positives, encourage vigilance, and monitor & assure our 
performance, we will hire independent red-team organizations
to regularly attempt to penetrate our secured buildings.

I've been the best before, and I'm going to do it again.
I've been on a three year hiatus, but I'm almost healed and ready to go
back into 100%. Last week I had the best work week in three years.

I'm going to move to Washington D.C. and be scrappy. I'm going to move in with
my parents in Alexandria, VA, only smoke pot when it's legal, and launch
the world's best surveillance company. And we're going to get rich doing it.

Why do this? So I can materialize greatness, play by the rules and [conquer Earth](##upgrade).
We'll call it Surv, pronounced serve.

How to deal with false positives? Tune the system to handle false positives.
Assume you won't get rid of false positives. Instead, increase the number of
true positives via red teams that model well the world of threats.
Then, operators operate under the assumption that 9 out of ten positives are false.
But the operator is actively searching for the true positives.
